 * Picks which mailbox messages a run should download and turn into dossiers:

 * IMAP connection (mailbox.ts) so "what counts as a new dossier message" is
 * testable without a mailbox.
 *
 * Deliberately not filtered by the IMAP \Seen flag - the flag lives on the
 * mailbox, shared across every Directus instance that ever connects to it (a
 * fresh server deployment, a colleague's local setup), so "already seen" does
 * not mean "already in this Directus". `knownSubjects`, sourced from this
 * instance's own `dossiers` collection, is the real source of truth for
 * dedup. The message is still marked \Seen after a successful ingest, purely
 * for mailbox hygiene - never relied on for correctness.
